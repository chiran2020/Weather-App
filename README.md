This Project is about Weather-App, and it will be mainly on JavaScript. My plan is to fetch weather API from the public weather API website. The end goal is to be able to search POPULAR cities from around the world. I will also use CSS for design to give it the best look. The future plan is to keep adding new features as I learn them. 
Some of the features I have in this project as of right now are:

Fetch data from API.
Converted that data to array pull key information such as Current date, Time, Day, and live Weather logo.
A function that accepts two or more values.
Displays Warning when weather is very high or low.
